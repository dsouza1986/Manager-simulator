# Maersk Marine Execution Manager Simulator - PWA Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the Maersk Marine Execution Manager Simulator as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your Android device.

## What is a Progressive Web App (PWA)?

A Progressive Web App provides an app-like experience that can be installed directly from your web browser without going through an app store. PWAs offer several advantages:

- No need to download a large APK file
- Updates automatically when you use the app
- Takes minimal storage space on your device
- Works offline or in poor network conditions
- Looks and feels like a native app

## Installation Instructions for Android

### Step 1: Access the PWA URL

1. Open Chrome browser on your Android device
2. Navigate to the URL where the PWA is hosted (this will be provided separately)
3. Wait for the page to fully load

### Step 2: Install the PWA

#### Method 1: Using the Installation Prompt

1. If you see a banner at the bottom of the screen saying "Add Maersk Simulator to Home Screen", tap on it
2. Tap "Install" in the confirmation dialog
3. The app will be installed on your home screen

#### Method 2: Using Chrome Menu

If you don't see the installation prompt:

1. Tap the three-dot menu (â‹®) in the top-right corner of Chrome
2. Select "Add to Home screen" from the dropdown menu
3. Confirm the app name (or edit if desired)
4. Tap "Add"
5. The app will be installed on your home screen

### Step 3: Launch the App

1. Go to your home screen
2. Find the Maersk Simulator icon
3. Tap to launch the app

The app will now open in full-screen mode without browser controls, giving you a native app-like experience.
